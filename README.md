# java-advent-of-code
Repository for AdventOfCode solutions

These are some of my Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com) solutions, done using Java. It's setup like this:
- Each year's Advent of Code is in a separate module -- for example, the advent-2020 module holds the Advent of Code solutions for 2020
- Each solution is in a package for the particular day
- The class with a main method is what you run to get the solution

Since this is Advent of Code, the problems are often solved after midnight...and once they're solved, I never go back and look at them again. This is good and bad: Good because it's an honest accounting of what I did at the time, and bad because there are clearly better ways to solve the problems that are never considered.

It's also somewhat incomplete
## Status of Events
- advent-2020: Completed with all 50 stars
- advent-2021 Partially completed (28 stars)
-- I forgot about this and was traveling for ArchConf, and with the drama of the log4j bug plus everything I was learning, I fell behind and lost the motivation to catch up. I should go back and finish this, just like I should actually learn Dijstra's algorithm so i don't have to research it every year. 
- advent-2022: In progress
